## Scenario 1: Don't catch cold

#### What problem does Scenario 1 solve?

In this scenario, we will use `Grove - Temp & Humidity` to develop a project called **Don't catch cold**. In this case, we are check the value of the temperature and humidity sensor, and then tell you not to catch cold when it lower then 30 degree. As the first project, we hope to let everyone get started quickly, without technical details. So just include one sensor: `Grove - Temp & Humidity`.

#### Hardware setup

Connecting `Grove - Temp&Humidity` sensor to GrovePi's D2 port, and then power the Raspberry Pi with USB.

hardware list:

1. Raspberry Pi 3
2. GrovePi+
3. Grove - Temp&Humidity
4. Grove Cable
